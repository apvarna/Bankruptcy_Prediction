This project focuses on predicting company bankruptcy using financial metrics. The dataset utilized contains a variety of financial ratios and performance indicators for over 90,000 companies. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that accurately identifies companies at risk of bankruptcy, which can be a valuable tool for investors, creditors, and other stakeholders.

Several machine learning models were employed to predict the likelihood of bankruptcy based on various financial metrics. The models used include:

<li> Logistic Regression: A baseline model to understand the relationship between the features and the probability of bankruptcy. </li>
<li> Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that improves prediction accuracy by averaging multiple decision trees. </li>
<li> XGBoost: A powerful gradient boosting algorithm known for its performance in classification tasks.</li>
<br>
Each model was trained and validated using a subset of the data, with hyperparameter tuning performed to optimize model performance.
